We often talk about discipline as this inhuman capacity to force ourselves to do the things we don't really want to do.
The rhetoric around discipline is often militarised, starting from the words we use, to the concepts we're expressing. We force ourselves, we bend reality to our will, we conquer the day. Words around discipline are hard and aggressive; they're forceful.  They're harsh.

As much as I'm a fan of "whatever works" when it comes to however we decide to live, I also think that often multiple things "work", but bring different degrees of ease into our lives. I like to add tiny caveat to that: "whatever works and brings the most peace".

That's where I feel we have it backward. We focus on developing discipline as if that were the end goal - whereas, to me, discipline is the tool by which we align ourselves to our values.

_What if instead of forcing ourselves to do the things we don't really want to do, we focused on making ourselves into the person that _wants_ to do those things?_

It can be almost mind-bending to associate the word "ease" with "discipline". If it is "easy" then you don't need discipline for it, right? No need to bend / push / force / conquer / annihilate. If we remove all of the extra baggage around the D word, all that's left, to me, is"the capacity to do the right thing at the right time". That's its naked core.
If we shape ourselves toward this, slowly chiseling away the marble to reveal what's underneath, then I'd argue that discipline not only becomes easier, it can become inevitable.

Discipline becomes nothing but a sequence of choices. The hardest, as always, is the first. After that, all you have to do is ask yourself: "is this the right thing?" - if it is, do it. If it's not, well, you can still do it, I'm not your mother.

But, at that moment, you've just snookered yourself into a misalignment; opening up an abyss of existential questions and excuses: "but I actually really love chocolate, and I read it's good for your heart" "you know, I'm tired today, I deserve a treat" "do I really want this?" and it will make the rest of your day (or your endeavour, or your life) a tiny little bit harder.
Because then, you *will* have to force it and you *will* have to bend and conquer, and that's because you're trying to get to a sprint from a dead stop. There is no momentum; no tailwinds to lift you up.

You didn't do the right thing when it didn't matter. You didn't make the tiny choice when nobody was looking (but you, you always are). And now that you want to do something important, wake up early in the morning, start a new habit, work out, discipline is indeed very _hard_. The values you've expressed don't reflect that, _so far_.
That's why I like to remove all of that muck: "is this the right thing?". The answer is binary. Yes or no. The key is to spend some time to really crystallise what right means for you.

I'd argue that cultivating discipline for discipline's sake is a superpower. And again, I am referring to the easy version of discipline. Wrap yourself and your identity around doing what's right. Let it snowball, and I promise you won't have to weaponise your own capacity to suffer anymore.ne for discipline's sake is a superpower. And again, I am referring to the easy version of discipline.

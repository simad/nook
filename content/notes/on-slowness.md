# On slowness

I've been thinking about slowness, recently. For the first time in what feels like forever, I've found myself yearning for slow mornings, the kind that smell of fresh ground coffee and feel like soft silk.
It's a bit ironic, considering I've forged part of my identity around my multiple interests, my machine-like efficiency and capacity to get a lot of stuff done.

And instead I find myself here, staring at plants, admiring little green leaves growing, with nowhere to be - physically _or_ mentally.

I am finding great joy in these pockets of apparent stillness. Under the surface, I feel that thoughts and insights are doing what they do best - they appear, make their presence known, and then gently recede. They thrive in this little space reserved for pure exploration.
It takes time for thoughts to sediment; and during this time, I like to think that we're planting small seeds. We don't know when one of these will blossom, or even if it will. Will it take root? What direction will it even take? What direction might it take _you_?

These seeds will slowly form the wisdom we're extrapolating from the world and our experiences. Their solidity is often proportional to the amount of time it took for them to form.

The opposite of slowness is moving fast. Thinking fast, producing fast. Technology is here to help us do more and do it quicker, but we also somehow seem to be in a rush to outsource to it the things that make us human.

The biggest competitive advantage (without considering social and societal aspects) we have versus modern AI is the capacity to be still. An AI is in standby until prompted; it does not "exist" unless it is producing something. Let's not make the same mistake.

Where can you find a little corner to give something your full, slow, undivided attention, today?
